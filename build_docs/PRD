Project Name: ITSM Ticket Platform
Description: A multi-tenant ITIL-compliant ITSM ticket system that facilitates natural language ticket creation, and automated ticket queue management.
Primary Goals: Streamline IT service management, automate ticket handling, and empower users with a self-service portal while ensuring tenant isolation and adherence to ITIL best practices.
Tech Stack & Environment
Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
Target Platform: Single-Page Application
Framework Versions & Config: Latest stable versions
Requirements & Features
Core Features:
Comprehensive ticket management: create, update, assign, and resolve tickets
Multi-tenant architecture ensuring data segregation and role-based access
Ability to segment teams with ticket queues
Customizable service catalog
Self-service portal for end users to submit and track tickets
Knowledge Base: Users can search for solutions to common problems before submitting a ticket.
Service Level Agreement (SLA) Management: Define SLAs, track compliance, and automate escalations.
Reporting and Analytics: Track key metrics such as ticket volume, resolution times, and customer satisfaction.
Change Management: Manage the process of making changes to the IT environment.
Problem Management: Identify the root causes of recurring incidents.
Survey and Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the ticket resolution process.
Automation of Routine Tasks: Automate ticket routing, assignment, and closure.
User Flows: Users sign up/in, browse the service catalog, create or update tickets, search the knowledge base, provide feedback, and managers review ticket statuses, SLA compliance, and reports.
Business Rules: Only authenticated users from a tenant can access their tickets; priority escalations are automatically triggered based on predefined SLAs; multi-tiered role access for technicians, managers, and administrators.
UI/UX Design
Layout: Dashboard-centric layout featuring a sidebar navigation, a central ticket list view, and detailed ticket panels on selection. The layout will incorporate a modern design with light gradients and glassmorphic effects to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Look & Feel: Professional, modern, and minimalistic with clear typography, consistent spacing, and a color scheme that reflects ITSM credibility. Glassmorphic elements will be used to add depth and a sense of sophistication, with subtle light gradients enhancing the visual appeal.
Components: Header and footer bars, navigation menu, service catalog display, ticket cards, detailed ticket view, authentication forms, knowledge base search, survey forms, and a self-service portal. These components will be styled with glassmorphic effects, light gradients, and a modern aesthetic to ensure a cohesive and visually stunning user experience.
Data Model & Supabase Setup
Database Schema: Design a schema that includes tables for Tenants, Users, Tickets, TicketHistory, Queues, Services, KnowledgeBaseArticles, SLAs, Reports, Changes, Problems, Surveys, and AutomationRules.
Row-Level Security: Enabled by default to ensure tenant data isolation and security across all endpoints.
Auth Requirements: Utilize Supabase Auth for multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and tenant-specific user management, including Google and Microsoft SSO.
Granular Implementation Plan
Page and Routing Structure
Create application pages: Home, Ticket Dashboard, Self-Service Portal, Service Catalog, Knowledge Base, Reporting, Change Management, Problem Management, and Surveys.
Set up placeholder components with 'Coming Soon' messages to verify route flows.
Ensure navigation follows clear, tenant-aware routing requirements.
UI/UX Implementation
Establish the base layout including responsive header, footer, and sidebar navigation.
Implement essential UI components such as buttons, forms, modals, service catalog display, knowledge base search, survey forms, and AI chat boxes, styled with glassmorphic effects and light gradients.
Maintain consistency with branding guidelines for typography, color scheme, and spacing, incorporating modern design principles.
Data Model Definition
Define TypeScript types for core entities: Tenant, User, Ticket, TicketHistory, Queue, Service, KnowledgeBaseArticle, SLA, Report, Change, Problem, Survey, and AutomationRule.
Draft an ERD using a Mermaid diagram placed in the docs folder to illustrate relationships and data flow.
Integrate Supabase Auth
Integrate Supabase Auth to implement sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows for users, including Google and Microsoft SSO.
Configure multi-tenant authentication with different roles (user, technician, manager, admin) and setup redirection after login/logout.
Embed error handling for invalid credentials and access denials.
Create Database Tables and Relations
Define and implement Supabase tables for Tenants, Users, Tickets, TicketHistory, Queues, Services, KnowledgeBaseArticles, SLAs, Reports, Changes, Problems, Surveys, and AutomationRules based on the ERD.
Establish foreign keys and other relationships to ensure referential integrity.
Prepare initial seed data if required by business rules.
Apply RLS (Row-Level Security) Policies
Enforce RLS policies in Supabase to restrict data access in accordance with tenant-specific roles and permissions.
Validate security transitions between authenticated and unauthenticated states for all roles.
API Development
Design and implement RESTful APIs using Supabase functions to perform CRUD operations on tickets, services, users, queues, knowledge base articles, SLAs, reports, changes, problems, surveys, and automation rules.
Secure APIs using Supabase's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Document API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
Integrate Real Data and Final Logic
Integrate Supabase queries and API calls to dynamically load tickets, services, knowledge base articles, SLAs, reports, changes, problems, and surveys.
Implement business logic for SLA management, change management workflows, problem management processes, survey processing, and automation rule execution.
Address edge cases like empty state views, network errors, and real-time updates.
Update Documentation
Update the README with detailed project structure, installation steps, API documentation, and usage instructions.
Revise diagrams and documentation to accurately reflect data flows, authentication mechanisms, and API endpoints.
Compile all changes and ensure the documentation is clear for future developers and maintainers.
