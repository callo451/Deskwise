AI Agent Task List: ITSM Platform Development
Objective: Generate code and configurations for the ITSM Platform based on user prompts and definitions, leveraging the provided React/Tailwind/TS/Vite template with a strong focus on multi-tenant architecture using Supabase. Human oversight will guide architecture, provide prompts, review outputs, and integrate components.

  - Added form validation and error display
  - Output: Auth components, AuthContext provider
  - Note: Google and Microsoft SSO to be implemented in future iterations
[x] 1.5 Generate Initial TypeScript Types:
  - Created TypeScript interfaces for User, Tenant, Ticket, and other entities
  - Ensured tenant_id is included in all tenant-specific types
  - Generated Database type for Supabase type safety
  - Output: Created src/types/database.ts
[ ] 1.6 Generate Mermaid ERD Draft (Optional):
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
Phase 2: Data Modeling & Backend Core
Goal: Generate database schema, tenant-isolating RLS policies, and tenant-aware core data access functions.
Tasks:
[x] 2.1 Generate Remaining TypeScript Types:
  - Created TypeScript interfaces for all entities including Queues, Services, KnowledgeBaseArticles, SLAs
  - Added tenant_id to all tenant-specific resource types
  - Created proper type definitions for Supabase operations (Row, Insert, Update)
  - Output: Comprehensive types in src/types/database.ts
[x] 2.2 Generate Supabase Schema (SQL):
  - Created core tables with proper tenant isolation:
    - tenants: Base table for multi-tenant architecture
    - users: User profiles with tenant association
    - tickets: Core ticket management with tenant_id
    - ticket_history: Audit trail for ticket changes
    - queues: Ticket organization by department/function
    - services: Service catalog offerings
    - knowledge_base_articles: Self-service knowledge repository
    - slas: Service level agreements
  - Ensured non-nullable tenant_id columns with proper foreign key references
  - Output: Applied SQL migrations to Supabase project
[x] 2.3 Generate RLS Policies (SQL):
  - Implemented strict tenant isolation policies for all tables
  - Created policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE operations
  - Enforced tenant-specific data access based on user's tenant_id
  - Implemented role-based policies for admin/manager operations
  - Output: Applied RLS policies to all tables in Supabase
[x] 2.4 Generate Core API/Client Functions:
  - Created Supabase client utility in src/lib/supabase.ts
  - Implemented authentication functions in AuthContext
  - Created tenant-aware data access patterns
  - Leveraged RLS for automatic tenant filtering
  - Output: API utility functions in contexts and components
Phase 3: Core Frontend Features
Goal: Generate UI components and integrate them, ensuring all data displayed and manipulated is correctly scoped to the user's tenant.
Tasks:
[x] 3.1 Generate Reusable UI Components:
  - Created Button component with variants using class-variance-authority
  - Implemented utility functions for class name merging
  - Created layout components (MainLayout, Header, Sidebar)
  - Output: UI components in src/components/ui/ and layout components in src/components/layout/
[x] 3.2 Generate Ticket Dashboard Components:
  - Created DashboardPage with ticket statistics and recent tickets
  - Implemented tenant-aware data fetching using RLS
  - Added placeholder routes for ticket details and creation
  - Output: Dashboard component in src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
  - Note: Detailed ticket components to be implemented in future iterations
[ ] 3.3 Generate Self-Service Portal Components:
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
[ ] 3.4 Generate Service Catalog Component:
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
[x] 3.5 Generate Frontend RBAC Logic:
  - Implemented role-based conditional rendering in Sidebar component
  - Created ProtectedRoute component for route-level access control
  - Integrated user role checks in components
  - Output: Role-based UI in Sidebar.tsx and App.tsx
Phase 4, 5: Supporting & Advanced Features
Goal: Generate backend and frontend code for remaining features, maintaining strict tenant isolation throughout.
Tasks:
[ ] For each feature (KB, SLA, Reporting, Change, Problem, Surveys, Automation, NLP):
(Multi-Tenancy Note): Apply multi-tenancy principles consistently: Add tenant_id to schemas, enforce via RLS, ensure client functions respect context, and UI only shows tenant-scoped data.
[ ] 4/5.x.1: Generate/Update TypeScript types (include tenant_id).
[ ] 4/5.x.2: Generate Supabase Schema SQL (include tenant_id column and FK).
[ ] 4/5.x.3: Generate Supabase RLS Policy SQL (enforce tenant_id match).
[ ] 4/5.x.4: Generate API/Client Functions (tenant-aware).
[ ] 4/5.x.5: Generate Frontend Components (display tenant-scoped data).
Output: Relevant type, SQL, service, and component files for each feature.
Phase 6: Testing, Refinement & Documentation
Goal: Assist in testing (including multi-tenant scenarios) and documentation generation.
Tasks:
[ ] 6.1 Generate Unit Tests:
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
[ ] 6.2 Generate E2E Test Outlines:
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
[ ] 6.3 Assist with Code Optimization:
  - Pending: Will be implemented in future iterations
[x] 6.4 Generate Documentation:
  - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, features, and setup instructions
  - Added detailed section on multi-tenancy approach using RLS, tenant_id columns, and JWT claims
  - Added code comments throughout the application
  - Output: Created README.md and added documentation to code files
Phase 7: Deployment & Go-Live
Goal: Assist in generating deployment configurations.
Tasks:
[ ] 7.1 Generate Deployment Config Files:
Receive target hosting provider.
Generate basic configuration files.
Output: Config file content.
[ ] 7.2 Generate CI/CD Workflow Files:
Receive target CI/CD platform.
Generate basic workflow YAML file.
Output: Workflow YAML file content.
Note: Human review, integration, complex debugging, thorough security validation (especially RLS for tenant isolation), and final deployment steps remain critical user responsibilities throughout the process.
