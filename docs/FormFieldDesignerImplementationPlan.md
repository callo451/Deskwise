# Form Field Designer Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for enhancing the form field designer in the Service Catalog Settings component to make it more advanced and user-friendly.

## Features to Implement
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering fields
- Sectioned form layout with collapsible sections
- Conditional routing options for dynamic forms
- Enhanced field types and properties
- Interactive preview mode
- Visual field type selector

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create a New Component Structure
- `FormFieldDesigner`: The main component that manages the form builder
- `FormSection`: A component for managing a section of fields
- `FormField`: A component for individual form fields
- `FieldTypeSelector`: A visual selector for field types
- `RoutingRuleBuilder`: A component for conditional logic

### Step 2: Update Data Models
- Enhance data models to support sections with collapsible UI
- Add more field properties (width, help text, validation)
- Define models for conditional routing rules
- Implement field dependencies

### Step 3: Implement Drag-and-Drop
- Dragging fields within a section
- Dragging fields between sections
- Reordering sections

### Step 4: Build the Visual Editor
- Create a tabbed interface (Fields, Routing, Preview)
- Implement a visual field type selector with icons
- Add collapsible sections
- Create an interactive field properties panel

### Step 5: Add Conditional Logic
- Implement a visual rule builder
- Support show/hide fields based on conditions
- Allow making fields required based on conditions
- Enable skipping to sections based on conditions

### Step 6: Create the Preview Mode
- Show how the form will look to users
- Allow testing conditional logic
- Highlight validation issues

## Implementation Approach
We will take an incremental approach:
1. First, enhance the data model and state management
2. Then implement the basic drag-and-drop functionality
3. Next, add the visual field type selector
4. Then implement the conditional routing
5. Finally, add the preview functionality

Each step will be implemented and tested separately to ensure stability.
